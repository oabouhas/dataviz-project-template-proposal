## Data

The
[Unemployment in America Per US State](https://github.com/justin-2028/Unemployment-in-America-Per-US-State/blob/main/Unemployment%20in%20America%20Per%20US%20State.csv),
loaded and parsed as CSV.

This dataset tracks unemployment per US state since 1976,
including additional areas like the District of Columbia and
major metropolitan divisions.



## Questions & Tasks

1. **Compare Unemployment Rates Across Different States:**

   - Visualize and compare the unemployment rates for each
     state to identify states with the highest and lowest
     unemployment rates.

2. **Analyze Trends in Unemployment Rates Over Time:**

   - Track how unemployment rates have changed over the
     years or months to identify trends or seasonal patterns
     in unemployment.

3. **Explore the Relationship Between Unemployment Rates and
   Economic Indicators:**

   - Investigate how unemployment rates correlate with other
     economic indicators such as GDP growth or inflation
     rates to understand the broader economic context.

4. **Examine the Distribution of Unemployment Rates:**

   - Create histograms or box plots to visualize the
     distribution of unemployment rates across states and
     identify any unusual patterns or outliers.

5. **Identify States with High Unemployment Risk Factors:**
   - Use the dataset to identify states with high
     unemployment rates and analyze potential factors
     contributing to their high unemployment levels.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
