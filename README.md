# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The
[Unemployment in America Per US State](https://github.com/justin-2028/Unemployment-in-America-Per-US-State/blob/main/Unemployment%20in%20America%20Per%20US%20State.csv),
loaded and parsed as CSV.

This dataset tracks unemployment per US state since 1976,
including additional areas like the District of Columbia and
major metropolitan divisions.



## Questions & Tasks

1. **Compare Unemployment Rates Across Different States:**

   - Visualize and compare the unemployment rates for each
     state to identify states with the highest and lowest
     unemployment rates.

2. **Analyze Trends in Unemployment Rates Over Time:**

   - Track how unemployment rates have changed over the
     years or months to identify trends or seasonal patterns
     in unemployment.

3. **Explore the Relationship Between Unemployment Rates and
   Economic Indicators:**

   - Investigate how unemployment rates correlate with other
     economic indicators such as GDP growth or inflation
     rates to understand the broader economic context.

4. **Examine the Distribution of Unemployment Rates:**

   - Create histograms or box plots to visualize the
     distribution of unemployment rates across states and
     identify any unusual patterns or outliers.

5. **Identify States with High Unemployment Risk Factors:**
   - Use the dataset to identify states with high
     unemployment rates and analyze potential factors
     contributing to their high unemployment levels.

Bar Chart: Unemployment Rates Across States

This bar chart visualization displaying "Unemployment Rates Across States," with different shades of blue representing unemployment rates for various U.S. states.
1.Color Coding: The use of darker shades of blue for higher unemployment rates works well for visual emphasis. The gradient gives a quick visual indication of which states have higher or lower rates.
2.Labels: The percentage labels on top of each bar make it easy to compare unemployment rates across states at a glance, which is effective for data communication.
3.Axis Titles: Both the x-axis (States) and y-axis (Unemployment Rate %) are clearly labeled, contributing to overall readability.

This project visualizes the relationship between the population and unemployment rate across different US states over time using a scatter plot.

X-axis: Total population of a state
Y-axis: Unemployment rate in the state
This visualization aims to provide insights into the employment status in different US states over time.

This graph visualizes the distribution of unemployment rates in the US for the year 2022 using a colored histogram. The histogram bars are colored based on the unemployment rate.

X-axis: Unemployment rate
Y-axis: Number of states
The histogram uses D3.js to render the bars and color them based on the unemployment rate.

This project visualizes unemployment rate data across various U.S. states for the year 2020. Using D3.js, it presents a box plot to highlight the distribution of unemployment rates, showing median, quartiles, and range (min-max) for each state. This is part of a data visualization project aimed at making statistical data on employment more accessible and insightful.

## Milestones
- County-Level Data: I will attempt to source and integrate county-level unemployment data to provide more granular insights into unemployment patterns within each state.
- Multi-Line Chart (All States Over All Years): I plan to create a comprehensive multi-line chart that visualizes the unemployment rate trends across all states for each year. This will help in identifying long-term patterns, spikes, or trends at the state level.
- Choropleth Map: I will finalize the Choropleth Map, which will visually display the unemployment rates across U.S. states, color-coded by rate. This map will serve as a geographic overview of the unemployment landscape.
- Diverse Graph Types: I intend to employ a variety of graphs, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and time-series graphs, to explore different aspects of the data. This diversity in visualization will provide multiple perspectives and uncover hidden patterns within the dataset.

  
## Current Progress
- Choropleth Map: Currently working on it and will have it done by next week (Week 10).
- Multi-Line Chart: Currently working on it and will have it done by next week (Week 10).
- HeatMap: Currently working on it and will have it done by next week (Week 10).
- Bubble Map: Finished in Week 9.
- Colored Histogram: Finished in Week 9.
